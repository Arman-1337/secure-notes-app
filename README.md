A client-side encrypted note sharing application that demonstrates modern web cryptography best practices using the Web Crypto API. Share sensitive information securely without trusting any server with your data.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîí **Client-side AES-GCM encryption** - Your data never leaves your device unencrypted
- üîë **PBKDF2 key derivation** - Password-based encryption with 100,000 iterations
- üåê **Shareable encrypted URLs** - Send notes through any communication channel
- ‚ö° **Zero server storage** - Notes exist only in URL parameters
- üõ°Ô∏è **Authenticated encryption** - Detects data tampering automatically
- üì± **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üé® **Dark theme UI** - Professional VS Code-inspired interface
- üìã **One-click sharing** - Copy encrypted URLs to clipboard

## üîç How It Works

1. **Encryption Process**: User enters plaintext note and password ‚Üí PBKDF2 derives AES key from password + random salt ‚Üí AES-GCM encrypts note with random IV ‚Üí Combined salt+IV+ciphertext encoded in shareable URL
2. **Sharing**: Encrypted URL can be shared through any medium (email, chat, etc.)
3. **Decryption Process**: Recipient opens URL ‚Üí Enters password ‚Üí Same PBKDF2 process derives key ‚Üí AES-GCM decrypts and authenticates data ‚Üí Plaintext displayed

**Technical Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, Web Crypto API, AES-GCM 256-bit, PBKDF2-SHA256

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

### What This Protects Against:
- ‚úÖ **Server-side data breaches** - No plaintext stored on servers
- ‚úÖ **Man-in-the-middle attacks** - End-to-end encryption
- ‚úÖ **Data tampering** - AES-GCM authenticated encryption
- ‚úÖ **Rainbow table attacks** - Unique salt per encryption
- ‚úÖ **Brute force attacks** - 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations

### What This Does NOT Protect Against:
- ‚ùå **Weak passwords** - Use strong, unique passwords
- ‚ùå **Compromised devices** - Malware can capture plaintext
- ‚ùå **Social engineering** - Don't share passwords directly
- ‚ùå **Browser vulnerabilities** - Keep your browser updated
- ‚ùå **Screen recording** - Be aware of your environment

### Threat Model
This app is designed for sharing moderately sensitive information (passwords, personal notes, small confidential data) between trusted parties. It assumes:
- You trust your browser's Web Crypto API implementation
- Communication channels for URL/password sharing are separate
- Recipients are authorized to access the information
- Devices used for encryption/decryption are not compromised

**Not suitable for**: Highly classified information, long-term storage, or scenarios requiring perfect forward secrecy.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-notes-app.git
cd secure-notes-app

# Install dependencies (for testing)
npm install

# Open in browser
open index.html
# OR serve with local server (recommended)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)"
5. Your app will be live at `https://arman-1337.github.io/secure-notes-app/`

### Deploy to Vercel
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyourusername%2Fsecure-notes-app)

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run security tests
npm run test:security
```

### Manual Security Testing
1. **Encryption Test**: Create note "Hello World" with password "test123" ‚Üí Should generate unique URLs each time
2. **Wrong Password Test**: Try decrypting with incorrect password ‚Üí Should fail gracefully
3. **Tampering Test**: Modify encrypted URL hash ‚Üí Should detect corruption

## üîß Configuration

Key security parameters (in `src/crypto-utils.js`):
```javascript
const PBKDF2_ITERATIONS = 100000; // OWASP recommended minimum
const SALT_LENGTH = 16;            // 128 bits
const IV_LENGTH = 12;              // 96 bits for AES-GCM
const KEY_LENGTH = 256;            // 256-bit AES key
```

## üöß Roadmap
